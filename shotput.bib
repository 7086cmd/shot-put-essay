Abstract      = {Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are
often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their
strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the
reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms
that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look
at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the
most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and
distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing
gradient descent.},

Abstract      = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but
not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals
are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming
style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent
with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient
and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
  In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of
PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every
aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its
user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key
components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling
performance.
  We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the
overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

Title         = {Universal Differential Equations as a Common Modeling Language for
  Neuroscience},
Eprint        = {2403.14510v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CE},
Abstract      = {The unprecedented availability of large-scale datasets in neuroscience has
spurred the exploration of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) both as
empirical tools and as models of natural neural systems. Their appeal lies in
their ability to approximate arbitrary functions directly from observations,
circumventing the need for cumbersome mechanistic modeling. However, without
appropriate constraints, DNNs risk producing implausible models, diminishing
their scientific value. Moreover, the interpretability of DNNs poses a
significant challenge, particularly with the adoption of more complex
expressive architectures. In this perspective, we argue for universal
differential equations (UDEs) as a unifying approach for model development and
validation in neuroscience. UDEs view differential equations as
parameterizable, differentiable mathematical objects that can be augmented and
trained with scalable deep learning techniques. This synergy facilitates the
integration of decades of extensive literature in calculus, numerical analysis,
and neural modeling with emerging advancements in AI into a potent framework.
We provide a primer on this burgeoning topic in scientific machine learning and
demonstrate how UDEs fill in a critical gap between mechanistic,
phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience. We outline a flexible
recipe for modeling neural systems with UDEs and discuss how they can offer
principled solutions to inherent challenges across diverse neuroscience
applications such as understanding neural computation, controlling neural
systems, neural decoding, and normative modeling.},
